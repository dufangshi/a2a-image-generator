  Accepts natural language prompts and produces AI-generated images accordingly.

- **Extensible Design**  
  Can be adapted to different backends or models for custom image generation workflows.

- **Demonstration of CrewAI**  
  Serves as a sample implementation showing how CrewAI can be used as an A2A agent for creative tasks.
